== DESCRIPTION

Ruby bindings for the newt library

Code is originally from Noritsugu Nakamura and is available at:
http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~Nori/ruby/dist/ruby-newt-20020105.tar.gz

It was maintained by Eric Sperano and moved to theforeman github page in 2015.

See http://github.com/theforeman/ruby-newt/tree/master/examples for usage examples.

== INSTALL

=== From rubygems.org

  $ gem install newt

=== From source

  $ gem install rake rake-compiler
  $ git clone git://github.com/theforeman/ruby-newt
  $ cd ruby-newt
  $ gem build newt.gemspec
  $ sudo gem install newt-*.gem

=== Development

  $ rake compile

== REQUIREMENTS

The Newt library and headers.

=== Fedora

  $ dnf install ruby-devel newt-devel

=== Ubuntu

  $ sudo apt-get install libnewt-dev

=== Mac OS X

  $ sudo port install libnewt

Then, define these environment variables:

  $ export LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/local/lib/"
  $ export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/opt/local/include/"

For some reason, it does not always find the header so symlink it:

  $ sudo ln -s /opt/local/include/newt.h  /usr/include/

== Migrating from 0.9 to 1.0

The following changes break compatibility with version 0.9 and existing
programs using the ruby-newt library may need to be changed.

* The following method names have been renamed to create a more consistent
  interface.
  * +takesFocus+ has been renamed to +takes_focus+
  * +setCurrentByKey+ has been renamed to +set_current_by_key+
  * +setData+ has been renamed to +set_data+
  * +clearSelection+ has been renamed to +clear_selection+
* The +get+/+set+ methods have been removed from the +Radiobutton+
  component.
* The +get_current+ method for +Listbox+ has been generalized and the
  +get_current_as_number+ and +get_current_as_string+ methods have been
  removed.
* Garbage collection of components and forms has been implemented. This will
  break applications that reuse components on multiple forms.
* The publicly global +CALLBACK_HASH+ has been removed. Applications that
  modify this hash directly will break.
* The various _add_callback_ methods no longer return the previously set
  callback when called with no parameters.
